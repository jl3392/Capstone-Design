# Capstone-Design
Data Science Course
Requirement: Create a writeup with these 3 ideas. Each idea has a link to the paper and the associated data set. 
## First idea
Compare the drug effect between two drugs
Background info: This is a data sheet from a previous interveiw I had.I messed it up at that time and would like to redo it. A medical company currently used Meidcaiton A in all their patinents and is considering a switch to Medication B. A critical part of the evaluation of Medication B would be used in a trial of Medication B was conducted. The data in the excel file encompasses roughtly 130 patients.
The good point to use this as a capstone design is that
* It has clear question/problem that need to solve. 
* The size of the data is properate ( 130 patients with 10,000 data). 
* It is related to healthcare industry which I am interested in.
## Second idea
Compare the heart beat data between patients and healthy people
Currently I am working in a research lab and have generated a bunch of acoustic signals of heart beats from healthy people and people with mild heart murmar. I would like to see whether the patients with mild heart murmur and healthy people have significant heart beat rates.
The main problem is that I do not have enough data. I have tested 6 volunteers, with three parallel testing of each of them. Two of them have mild heart murmur.
## Third idea
I was working at a pharmaceutical manufacturing site monitoring the safety issue. I have collected all the safety reports in the past three years and would like to analyze the distribution and affecting factors  ( such as season, location, department) of the safety issues.
