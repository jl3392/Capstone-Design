# Cancer or Not: Classification of Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

## Abstract
The Breast Cancer project aims to develop a system that takes breast features as inputs, and outputs the likelihood that the patient is malignant, in order to facilitate early diagnosis of breast cancer. Unique and relevant features such as statistical measures (mean, standard deviation and covariance) of the breast's shape information (area, diameter, compactness and asymmetry) was extracted from the pre-processed images. Texture information, obtained from a gray level covariance matrix was also included. A trained classifier will then compute the likelihood that the lesion is malignant and return this percentage to the user. The dataset of the breas cancer information can be accessed from build-in python package sklearn.dataset.load_breast_cancer.

## Backgroud
Breast cancer is one of the most dangerous form of cancers in the world. Annually, Breast caner kills an estimated 20,000 people in the US. If breast cancer is recognized and treated early, it is almost curable, with a 80 to 90% 5-year survival rate when treated with simple excision. Early diagnosis of the breast cancer will help save thousands of lives.

## Method
Machine learning with logistic regression and SVM will be used in this project. The script is writtern in python 3.6.
