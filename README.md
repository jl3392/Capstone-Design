# Heart Rate Monitor with Acoustic Sensors
This project works on designing the software of a heart rate monitor, aiming to compare the heart acoustic signal:
Estimate the heart sound at different positions (carotid and chest)
Compare the heart sound between healthy people and patients with heart murmur
Indicate the heart murmur charcterisic throught the data analysis.

## Backgroud
In the previous study, acoustic detection has been used for coronary artery disease. Using the acoustic sensor system, Winther et al. (2015) identified the mid diastolic heart sound periods and filtered out the noise. Yet, rare study has been reported to detect the mitral valve prolapse through acoustic-based methods. In this study, the typical system was set up to detect the mitral valve prolapse through acoustic approach, Fourier transform method was used to analyze the spectral energy.

## Method
Matlab and Python scripts are written to analyze the data.
